/**
 * \mainpage liblist
 *
 * \section purpose Purpose
 *
 * liblist provides a simple abstraction around doubly-linked
 * lists. The following are the basic and common arguments for the use
 * of any such library:
 *   - A client program needs not reimplement such a common algorithm.
 *   - Sharing well-tested and proven code eliminates one source of
 *     failure or mistake-making.
 *   - Using an API's functions generally results in cleaner and clearer
 *     code than directly manipulating members of data structures.
 *
 * \section api API
 *
 * liblist's public API is defined in list.h and \ref
 * list_traversal. A list handle is represented by the list_t
 * typedef. This is initialized with list_init() and freed with
 * list_free().
 *
 * A list handle has a front, rear, and current element. The current
 * element may be accessed with list_curr() and the other elements
 * would be access with similarly named functions. Inserting new
 * elements into the list causes the current element to refer to the
 * newly inserted element. The current element pointer may also be
 * changed with list_mvnext(), list_mvprev(), list_mvfirst(), and
 * list_mvrear().
 *
 * When updating or accessing a list, often operations are performed
 * on the whole list at once or a search is done to find a certain
 * element in the list. These operations may be performed using the
 * basic list manipulation functions mentioned above. One may apply a
 * function conforming to list_traverse_func_t to list elements using
 * list_traverse(). The return value of this function can interrupt
 * the traversal and the traversal can update the current element,
 * making it useful for performing searches.
 *
 * \section alternate_paradigms Alternate Paradigms
 *
 * The doubly-linked list structure can easily be treated as if it
 * supports the queue and stack paradigms. For example, restricting
 * yourself to list_insert_before(), list_front(), and
 * list_remove_front() lets the list behave as a stack. stack.h and
 * queue.h provide macros to provide alternate interfaces.
